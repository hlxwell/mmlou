This file is mainly intended for users of <a
href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a> v1.1. For a full list of changes see
the CHANGELOG file and believe me, there are MANY a cool, new feature
there!!
</p>
<h2>API changes between <a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a> 1.1 and <a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a> 1.2</h2>
<ul>
<li>l_strftime has had it argument ordcer reversed. It is now
l_strftime(fmt,date) instead of l_strftime(date,fmt)

</li>
<li>l_datetime_short() has been removed. Feel free to add as many date/time
formats as you like though. Use the new !!datetime_fmt directive. (See the
sample app)

</li>
<li>Date/time formats no longer require double hash-symbols. ie.
&#8217;%%A&#8217; is now just &#8217;%A&#8217;.

</li>
<li>Some localized strings used for Rails date/time helpers have been changed.
actionview_datehelper_select_*_prefix has been renamed to
actionview_datehelper_select_*_suffix

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Design change</h2>
<p>
When I first created <a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a>, I designed it
so that language settings cascaded. So you could have a global language
setting, and you could set a certain controller to have another certain
language setting, and then setting the language in instances of that
controller would only effect that instance, etc etc. First of all, not only
did I find myself never actually needing that behaviour, but other users
also found it confusing. Many users would set the language in the
controller and then not understand why they would also need to explictly
set the language of model instances before running validation methods. Well
this behaviour has been replaced by a simpler, one-language-per-process
model. In simple mode (which is now the default), there is only one
language setting and it is shared by all instances and classes. This means
you will now only need to call set_language() once-per-action. If you want
to enable the old cascading behaviour, you still can by calling <a
href="../classes/GLoc.html#M000002">GLoc.set_language_mode</a>(:cascading)
</p>
<h2>Sample <a href="../classes/GLoc.html">GLoc</a> Application</h2>
<p>
To see the new functionality in action, it&#8216;s best just to have a look
at the new sample application. Specially for the new stuff like
!!datetime_fmt and !!sameas Check it out here:
